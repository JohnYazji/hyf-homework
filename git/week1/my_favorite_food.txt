TABBOULEH SALAD (PARSLEY SALAD)
A Lebanese friend showed me how to make this back in
1996. It's my mother-in-laws favourite salad and I
normally make it on request specially for her. I prefer flat
leaf fresh parsley (also known as Italian Parsley) as it's
better texture but curly leaf is alright. I normally buy the
parsley and spring onions from the supper market
prepacked bunches so if your measurements are slightly
more or less it's alright, it doesn't have to be exact. The
bourghul also soaks a lot of the moisture and I like
Tabbouli to be moist not dried that's why there is a lot of
lemons and olive oil. Like everything we cook it's all
about the palate and who we are cooking for so if you
choose to put less oil and lemons then it's ok. Salt and
black pepper to taste, so feel free to add less but not to
much. The secret to good Tabbouli is that everything
should be finely chopped. Enjoy
