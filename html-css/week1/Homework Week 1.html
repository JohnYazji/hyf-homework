        <h2> About Me</h2>
        <p>I graduated from the faculty of education (The psychological counseling department) from Damascus University in 2007. And I have a postgraduate diploma in education “leadership management and change” in 2013, from Middlesex University, Dubai, UAE.
            <br> I would like to learn and become a professional in this field because I have the ambition to learn computer languages and creating websites for a long time, as well as to learn how to build mobile APPs.
            <br> I am very interested in the web-development and I would love to learn how to build full-stack applications as well as HTML, CSS, Command Line, Git, JavaScript, Node.js, React.js, and MySQL. I was always thinking that coding is very difficult to learn and man needs a long time to be good at it. Especially, when I was going through the “view page source” and “inspect” on the web pages and seeing thousands of scripts there. But when I have been introduced to your program by one of my friends and I have watched some videos about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I recognized that is things can be done by time and with some special efforts.
